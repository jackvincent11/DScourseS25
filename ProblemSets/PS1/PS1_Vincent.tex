\section{Introduction}
My interest in taking this class stems from the desire to continue working on my coding skills and becoming more educated in the world of coding as it may relate to the field of economics. As far as the project, I think it would be really cool to predict stock markets movements based on historical data and/or relevant economic indicators using machine learning or something related. Some of my goals for this class are to simply improve at coding and do well in the class. Coding is an area I have definitely struggled with in the past. Following graduation, I hope to work for a financial institution in the area of economic analysis as it relates to asset markets.
